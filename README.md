API-Mock is a [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) [npm](https://npmjs.org/) module that generates a mock server (express) from your API specification. Document your API in the [API blueprint](http://apiblueprint.org/) format, and API-Mock mocks your routes and sends the responses defined in the api spec.

# Install

API-Mock requires node.js, and npm.

    npm install -g api-mock

## Installing from source

If you wish to install from source, you will need to build the library files manually (only the CoffeeScript source is committed to the repository). To do this, simply run:

    scripts/build

or 
    
    npm build
